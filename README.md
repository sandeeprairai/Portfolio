## Projects

In this project, I have used a naive Bayes machine Learning algorithm to classify the Email messages. The Naive Bayes Algorithm always gives the best result with textual data  There are various categories that come under the naive Bayes Gaussian Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Complement Naive Bayes, and Bernoulli Naive Bayes.

This project is made using a Logistic Regression  Algorithm. This project is quite interesting while we are targeting any team. Ultimately the goal is to make this project is to learn how To clean the data, Perform the EDA, Train the model, Test the model, and convert it into a web application.

This project is made using a random Forest Algorithm. This project is useful for the person those are wants to book a flight from different cities. Ultimately the goal is to make this project is to learn how To clean the data, Perform the EDA, Train the model, Test the model and convert it into a web application.

In this project, I applied various SQL queries such as group by, where clause window function etc to extract the information from  the Titanic dataset. This dataset is collected from  kaggle .whenever there is need of cleaning done using sql .The Primary goal to do case study is when we get the real-time problem how to handle those problems using sql various query.

- Steps
- Gathering the data(Data Gathered from Kaggle )
- Cleaning (Data Cleaning is done using sql)
- Made the interactive dashboard in tableau dashboard and connect to mysql server.

## Micro Projects
- ### Statistics and Machine Learning
- [Linear Regression ](https://github.com/sandeeprairai/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Linear%20Regression/Gradient_Descent_step_by_step.ipynb) : In this file, I aim to solve linear regression using analytical method and also by implementing gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent and minibatch gradient descent algorithms.
- [House Prediction Using Linear Regression](https://github.com/sandeeprairai/django2/blob/Django/House_Price_Prediction_in%20Django/app/views.py): In this project I have applied Linear Regression Algorithm on A house data set and then converted it into a website using django freamework,
