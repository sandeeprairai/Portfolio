In this project, I have used a naive Bayes machine Learning algorithm to classify the Email messages.The Naive Bayes Algorithm always gives the best result with textual data  There are various categories that come under the naive Bayes Gaussian Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Complement Naive Bayes, and Bernoulli Naive Bayes.

## Micro Projects
- ### Statistics and Machine Learning
- [Linear Regression ](https://github.com/sandeeprairai/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Linear%20Regression/Gradient_Descent_step_by_step.ipynb) : In this file, I aim to solve linear regression using analytical method and also by implementing gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent and minibatch gradient descent algorithms.
- [House Prediction Using Linear Regression](https://github.com/sandeeprairai/django2/blob/Django/House_Price_Prediction_in%20Django/app/views.py): In this project I have applied Linear Regression Algorithm on A house data set and then converted it into a website using django freamework,
